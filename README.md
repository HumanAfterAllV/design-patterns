# Design Patterns in Python & TypeScript

This repository showcases the implementation of classic design patterns in **Python** - **C#** - **TypeScript**, crafted with a focus on clean code, real-world problem solving, and aesthetic presentation.

## 🎯 Why this project?

As a frontend developer passionate about architecture and user experience, I'm building this collection to:

- 💡 Deepen my understanding of software design principles.
- 🧱 Practice cross-language pattern implementation.
- 🔍 Explore how each pattern can be applied to real-world problems.
- 🎨 Complement each pattern with **hand-drawn diagrams** using [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) for a more intuitive, human touch.

Each pattern includes:
- A brief explanation
- Pseudocode-based problem description
- Implementation in Python and TypeScript
- Diagrams for clarity and beauty

> The goal? To impress, to teach, and to reinforce design thinking through code and visuals.
